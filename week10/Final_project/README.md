## About Project_33:

> Victor Yaichnikov's new project is called "33". They are really thirty three human faces united by terrestrial lifetime and an image of Christ. The allusion is obvious: an epistyle of templon, an iconostasis, a medieval polyptich.

> And almost at once, by contrast, there is a doubt: whether similar unambiguity of interpretation is lawful? The infinite variety of images of human cosmos overturns any even most settled and time-honoured scheme.

> Here they are beside: the native, the hardly familiar and casually seen friends , the bible characters and our contemporaries, children, old men, the baby at mother’s breast, the enamored and simply kissing…

> A picturesque technique (acryle, oil) aggravates feelings of the borderline intonations in its genre sense: not a portfolio, but also not the cabinet grotesque.

> Searching of uniform hierarchy of values in this case is hardly probable pertinent.

> However, here that the artist speaks: "It would be better to break off a distance between people. In fact we do not look at each other in the eyes!" The matter is not only in an author's reflection. The faces, as well as destinies are connected unpredictably,
linked with each other. Whether this certificate of embodiment of the divine plan in any Brown movement, especially, in the elementary sequence of objects. The communication of the plan and the stunning result shown to us is not argued (conclusive).
